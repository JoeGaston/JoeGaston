Hi, I'm Joe.

I am a software engineer @100Devs.

When I'm not working on projects there I am:

:bar_chart: Developing and managing a non-profit - Adaptive Climbing Coalition.

:desktop_computer: Designing and building simulations and intelligence products for the Dept. of Defense.

:climbing: Planning my next multi-pitch or alpine ascent!

:ok_hand: Living intentionally.
